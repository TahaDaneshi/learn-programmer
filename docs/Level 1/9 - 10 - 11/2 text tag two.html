    <h2>What are the stars?</h2>
    <p>The <i>stars</i> are tiny points of light in the space. On a clear night we
        can see around <i>2,000</i> to <i>3,000 stars</i> without using a telescope. <i>Stars</i>
        look tiny in the sky because they are far away from the Earth. In
        ancient times the sky watchers found patterns of <i>stars</i> in the sky.
